## Instructions

The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Landing Page project. You'll need to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This will require modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

To get started, open `js/app.js` and start building out the app's functionality

For specific, detailed instructions, look at the project instructions in the Udacity Classroom.

Landing page project is my first project, I ran into some chalanges like building the navigation and make it update once more sections is added, figuring out the best way to loop the node list, creating the <a> anchor, getting rid of the red color once the link is clicked, changing the style of it, setting the class of the section to active, and the scroll smoothly, and while I am applying the scrollTO behavior : 'smooth' I made the set class to active the right way.

Features:
- once the nodelist updated , it is in the nav bar with all the functionality
